# **Movie Data Analytics Project**
## **Overview**
This project involves the analysis of a movie dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset was cleaned to ensure data integrity and various visualizations were created to understand different aspects of the dataset. Additionally, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to reveal relationships between variables such as revenue, genre, and user ratings.

## **Project Details**
### **Data Cleaning**
The initial step of the project involved cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and standardize data formats. 
This was crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses. 
Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were utilized for data manipulation and cleaning tasks.

### **Data Analysis**
A series of analyses were conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This included:

Descriptive Statistics: Understanding the distribution of variables such as revenue, user ratings, and genre frequencies.
Visualization: Created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to depict patterns and trends within the dataset. This included histograms, scatter plots, and box plots among others.
Correlation Analysis: Pearson correlation analysis was used to identify relationships between different variables in the dataset. This helped in understanding factors influencing revenue and user ratings.
Documentation
A  documentation was created within the Jupyter Notebook to document the entire data cleaning and analysis process.
